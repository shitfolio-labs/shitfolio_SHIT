## About

<p>SHITFOLIO is a cryptocurrency-only portfolio composed of index strategies. The token sale tax funding will be used to buy the underlying cryptocurrency assets and SHITFOLIO will hold the top 10 emerging cryptocurrencies by considering multiple factors such as market capitalization, current price, potential, etc. Index funds have consistently beaten the average managed fund since their inception and when it comes to emerging coins, moon is the final destination.
SHITFOLIO is not a platform, it is a fully functioning product and its token value is not based on speculation but rather on the product benefits and net profit of the 10 underlying cryptocurrencies. There are no broker fees or advice fees. SHITFOLIOâ€™s utility token is called SHIT. It can be traded at any time, holdings are fully transparent and there are no legacy banking fees or expensive fund managers.
SHITFOLIO allows for access to a diverse emerging cryptocurrency portfolio by holding a single token. The tokens will be tradable on PancakeSwap and later on bigger exchanges. The top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization change, and so will SHITFOLIOâ€™s holdings. The rebalancing process allows for tracking of the cryptocurrency market index and is an effective risk mitigation strategy.
A cryptocurrency portfolio based on a hybrid index system consisting of the 10 hidden gem coins, with weekly rebalancing and a component cap of 15% produces a combination that has broad market exposure and acceptable turnover without allowing a single asset to dominate.
